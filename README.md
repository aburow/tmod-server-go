chatgpt convert of python tmod server updater to go... Still works, it's a bit faster.

I wrote these programs because our kids have tMod servers that can go through fast cycles of updates that are a PITA to keep up with manually. They can now update the servers themselves. I don't have an automated solutions at this stage that imports the mods they want to use... maybe one day. They also want to be able to download their maps and share them so the pre-upgrade archives serve a double purpose of backup and sharing.

Syntax:
./vu check
./vu upgrade

This was written for tMod running in a proxmox container with a couple of tweaks to get the system running fully. Instructions are in the python tmod-server-updater readme.md
